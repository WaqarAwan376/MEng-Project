Modern software systems have become significantly complex with the growing demand for features, and the need for them to be efficient and reliable has also increased. To manage this complexity, software developers have adopted advanced architectures. However, over the years, as new features are added, software systems tend to become less reliable, requiring regular maintenance. Maintaining such large systems is not a simple task, and a significant amount of resources is needed just to understand and debug even small issues. Among the various solutions to address this problem, reverse engineering appears to be one of the most feasible options, as it helps visualize and analyze the problem at hand. Surprisingly, the tools available for reverse engineering large distributed systems are limited, and those that do exist are not very flexible in terms of supporting different technologies or focusing on specific parts of an application. This report presents a framework capable of reverse engineering the static source code of any distributed system using the Unified Data Source (UDS) approach. We will consider real-world scenarios that commonly arise during software maintenance and use a microservices-based application to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. By reverse engineering specific parts of the application, we aim to validate the practicality and credibility of our approach in real-world applications.
