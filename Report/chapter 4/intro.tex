In the previous chapters, we discussed the vision and technical strategy we will employ to demonstrate the framework's complete working. This chapter will discuss the critical implementation points, especially those related to probes and the single source of truth. We will discuss what approach to use for extracting data through probes, how probes are integrated with the SST, how the runner script will run all the probes and send the data to the SST, how data is stored in the SST, and how we can use it to integrate with a visualizer for further analysis.
