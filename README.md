# Reverse Engineering Microservices using Single Source of Truth for Enhanced Insights

## Project Overview

Modern software systems are increasingly complex, requiring efficient maintenance. Over time, added features reduce reliability, making debugging resource-intensive. **Reverse engineering** offers a viable solution by visualizing and analyzing system structures. This project introduces a framework for reverse engineering static source code in distributed systems using the **Unified Data Source (UDS)** approach. Through real-world scenarios and a microservices-based application, we demonstrate its effectiveness in software maintenance.
