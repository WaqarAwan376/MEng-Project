# Reverse Engineering Microservices using Single Source of Truth for Enhanced Insights

## Project Overview

Modern software systems are increasingly complex, requiring efficient maintenance. Over time, added features reduce reliability, making debugging resource-intensive. **Reverse engineering** offers a viable solution by visualizing and analyzing system structures. This project introduces a framework for reverse engineering static source code in distributed systems using the **Unified Data Source (UDS)** approach. Through real-world scenarios and a microservices-based application, we demonstrate its effectiveness in software maintenance.

## Test Project

The test project used in this report is a Java Spring framework-based project called
Petclinic, which is mentioned in subsection 2.3.3. It is important to note that all
the data we extract from the system is specific to this project setting. The artifacts
that extract the data from the projects are supposed to be written for the subject
systems depending on their requirements, settings and technology.

## Folder Structure

- **`Report/`** – Contains the project report and related documents.
- **`Source/`** – Contains the source code for the project.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `Source` folder to access the code.
2. Open the `Report` folder for documentation and project details.
